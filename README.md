This was an extremely short, simple prototype for OpenJam 2019. This was my first game jam, so it is largely incomplete. I was not able to get as much done as I had hoped, but the core concept is there. One grid of hexes with one color.

Click on the white, empty hexes to place a colored dot within them. Create a connection between the hexes containing an X!

Future additions may include more puzzles with more colors and bigger grids, background music, menus, and an editor to create your own levels.

As part of OpenJam, participants were encouraged to use open source tools. I used Godot and Aseprite in the making of this prototype.
